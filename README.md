## **Project Steps**

### **1. Data Collection**

* Downloaded YouTube trending datasets from Kaggle for **10 countries**.
* Each dataset contains video ID, title, channel name, category, views, likes, dislikes, comments, publish time, tags, and description.

### **2. Data Cleaning & Standardization**

* Standardized column names and date formats.
* Removed duplicates and missing entries.
* Converted timestamps to a consistent format.
* Mapped category IDs to category names using a JSON mapping file.

### **3. Sentiment Analysis**

* Used **TextBlob** to calculate sentiment polarity (-1 to +1) for video titles and tags.
* Categorized sentiment as Negative, Neutral, or Positive to understand its effect on engagement.

### **4. SQL-Based Analysis**

* Imported the cleaned dataset into **SQLite**.
* Ran queries to rank video categories by average views and engagement metrics.
* Derived regional insights for top-performing genres.

### **5. Power BI Storytelling Dashboard**

* Imported cleaned data into Power BI.
* Built interactive visuals including:

  * **Global Overview:** Views, likes, top categories
  * **Sentiment Analysis:** Scatter plots, box plots by country
  * **Trending Duration:** Histograms, line charts, and tables
* Added slicers for country, category, and sentiment.
* Designed text boxes for insights and storytelling flow.

### **6. Insights & Findings**

* Entertainment and Music categories dominate trending lists globally.
* Positive and emotionally engaging titles attract higher views and likes.
* Most videos trend for 2–3 days, while some categories maintain longer visibility.
* Regional differences in engagement patterns are evident across countries.
